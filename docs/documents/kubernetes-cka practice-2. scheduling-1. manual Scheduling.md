1. A pod definition file nginx.yaml is given. Create a pod using the file.
Only create the POD for now. We will inspect its status next.
```
kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
```

2. What is the status of the created POD?
```
kubectl get pod
```
3. Why is the POD in a pending state?
Inspect the environment for various kubernetes control plane components.
```

```
4. Manually schedule the pod on node01.
Delete and recreate the POD if necessary.
```
spec:
  nodeName: node01
```
5. Now schedule the same pod on the controlplane node.
Delete and recreate the POD if necessary.
```
spec:
  nodeName: controlplane
```
