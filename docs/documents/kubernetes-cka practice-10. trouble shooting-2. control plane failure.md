1. The cluster is broken. We tried deploying an application but it's not working. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.<br>
Start looking at the deployments.
    -  vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml  수정


2. Scale the deployment app to 2 pods.
    - app deploy의 replicaset를 2로 수정


3. Even though the deployment was scaled to 2, the number of PODs does not seem to increase. Investigate and fix the issue.<br>
Inspect the component responsible for managing deployments and replicasets.
    - vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml 로 conf 파일명 수정



4. Something is wrong with scaling again. We just tried scaling the deployment to 3 replicas. But it's not happening.<br>
Investigate and fix the issue.
    - vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml 로 WRONG-PKI-DIRECTORY 경로 pki로 수정
