1. How many pods exist on the system?
In the current(default) namespace.
```
kubectl get pods
```

2. Create a new pod with the nginx image.
```
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
```




3. How many pods are created now?
Note: We have created a few more pods. So please check again.
```
kubectl get pods
```



4. What is the image used to create the new pods?
You must look at one of the new pods in detail to figure this out.
```
kubectl describe pod newpods-7cbcd
```




5. Which nodes are these pods placed on?
You must look at all the pods in detail to figure this out.
```
kubectl get pod -o wide
```
```
NAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE           NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
newpods-7cbcd   1/1     Running   0          6m59s   10.42.0.11   controlplane   <none>           <none>
newpods-gxnnk   1/1     Running   0          6m59s   10.42.0.9    controlplane   <none>           <none>
newpods-wsfn7   1/1     Running   0          6m59s   10.42.0.10   controlplane   <none>           <none>
nginx           1/1     Running   0          3m33s   10.42.0.12   controlplane   <none>           <none>
```


6. Which nodes are these pods placed on?
You must look at all the pods in detail to figure this out.
```
kubectl get pod
```
```
NAME            READY   STATUS         RESTARTS   AGE
newpods-7cbcd   1/1     Running        0          8m12s
newpods-gxnnk   1/1     Running        0          8m12s
newpods-wsfn7   1/1     Running        0          8m12s
nginx           1/1     Running        0          4m46s
webapp          1/2     ErrImagePull   0          36s
```


7. What images are used in the new webapp pod?

You must look at all the pods in detail to figure this out.
```
 kubectl describe pod webapp
```


8. What is the state of the container agentx in the pod webapp?

Wait for it to finish the ContainerCreating state
```
kubectl describe pod  webapp
```


9. Why do you think the container agentx in pod webapp is in error?

Try to figure it out from the events section of the pod.
```
kubectl describe pod  webapp
```

10. What does the READY column in the output of the kubectl get pods command indicate?
```
running Containers in pod/total containers in pod
```


11. Delete the webapp Pod.
```
kubectl delete pod webapp
```




12. Create a new pod with the name redis and the image redis123.
Use a pod-definition YAML file. And yes the image name is wrong!
```
kubectl run redis --image=redis123
```





13. Now change the image on this pod to redis.

Once done, the pod should be in a running state.
```
kubectl edit pod redis
```
