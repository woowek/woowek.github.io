1. Create a new service account with the name pvviewer. Grant this Service account access to list all PersistentVolumes in the cluster by creating an appropriate cluster role called pvviewer-role and ClusterRoleBinding called pvviewer-role-binding.<br>
Next, create a pod called pvviewer with the image: redis and serviceAccount: pvviewer in the default namespace.
    - k create serviceaccount pvviewer
    - k create clusterrole pvviewer-role --resource=persistentvolumes --verb=list
    - k create clusterrolebinding pvviewer-role-binding --clusterrole=pvviewer-role --serviceaccount=default:pvviewer
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: pvviewer
  name: pvviewer
spec:
  containers:
  - image: redis
    name: pvviewer
  # Add service account name
  serviceAccountName: pvviewer
```



2. List the InternalIP of all nodes of the cluster. Save the result to a file /root/CKA/node_ips.<br>
Answer should be in the format: InternalIP of controlplane<space>InternalIP of node01 (in a single line)
    - kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.addresses[?(@.type=="InternalIP")].address}' > /root/CKA/node_ips




3. Create a pod called multi-pod with two containers.
Container 1: name: alpha, image: nginx
Container 2: name: beta, image: busybox, command: sleep 4800
Environment Variables:
container 1:
name: alpha
Container 2:
name: beta
    - Solution manifest file to create a multi-container pod multi-pod as follows:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: multi-pod
  name: multi-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: alpha
    resources: {}
    env:
    - name: name
      value: alpha
  - image: busybox
    name: beta
    resources: {}
    command: [ "sleep", "4800" ]
    env:
    - name: name
      value: beta
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```





4. Create a Pod called non-root-pod , image: redis:alpine
runAsUser: 1000
fsGroup: 2000
    - Solution manifest file to create a pod called non-root-pod as follows:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: non-root-pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    fsGroup: 2000
  containers:
  - name: non-root-pod
    image: redis:alpine
```



5. and a service called np-test-service. Incoming connections to this service are not working. Troubleshoot and fix it.
Create NetworkPolicy, by the name ingress-to-nptest that allows incoming connections to the service over port 80.
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: ingress-to-nptest
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      run: np-test-1
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```



6. Taint the worker node node01 to be Unschedulable. Once done, create a pod called dev-redis, image redis:alpine, to ensure workloads are not scheduled to this worker node. Finally, create a new pod called prod-redis and image: redis:alpine with toleration to be scheduled on node01.<br>
key: env_type, value: production, operator: Equal and effect: NoSchedule
    - k taint node node01 env_type=production:NoSchedule
    - k run dev-redis --image=redis:alpine
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: prod-redis
spec:
  containers:
  - name: prod-redis
    image: redis:alpine
  tolerations:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: env_type
    operator: Equal
    value: production
```




7. Create a pod called hr-pod in hr namespace belonging to the production environment and frontend tier .<br>
image: redis:alpine<br>
Use appropriate labels and create all the required objects if it does not exist in the system already.
    - kubectl create namespace hr
    - kubectl run hr-pod --image=redis:alpine --namespace=hr --labels=environment=production,tier=frontend



8. A kubeconfig file called super.kubeconfig has been created under /root/CKA. There is something wrong with the configuration. Troubleshoot and fix it.
    - k get node --kubeconfig /root/CKA/super.kubeconfig
    - cat .kube/config
    - 9999를 6443으로 변경


9. We have created a new deployment called nginx-deploy. scale the deployment to 3 replicas. Has the replica's increased? Troubleshoot the issue and fix it.
    - kubectl get pods -n kube-system
    - kubectl scale deploy nginx-deploy --replicas=3
    - /etc/kubernetes/manifest    -> kubecontroller-manager 오타 수정
