1. In this practice test we will install weave-net POD networking solution to the cluster. Let us first inspect the setup.<br>
We have deployed an application called app in the default namespace. What is the state of the pod?
    - kubectl get pod 명령어 사용



2. Inspect why the POD is not running.
    -  describe pod app 사용


3. Deploy weave-net networking solution to the cluster.<br>
NOTE: - We already have provided a weave manifest file under the /root/weave directory.
    - k apply -f weave-daemonset-k8s.yaml
