1. Inspect the environment and identify the authorization modes configured on the cluster.<br>
Check the kube-apiserver settings.
    - kubectl describe pod kube-apiserver-controlplane -n kube-system | grep auth 명령어로 옵션 체크


2. How many roles exist in the default namespace?
    - kubectl get roles 명령어 실행


3. How many roles exist in all namespaces together?
    - kubectl get roles -A 로 확인


4. What are the resources the kube-proxy role in the kube-system namespace is given access to?
    - kubectl describe role kube-proxy -n kube-system  로 확인


5. What actions can the kube-proxy role perform on configmaps?
    - kubectl describe role kube-proxy -n kube-system 의 verbs 로 확인


6. Which of the following statements are true?
    - 


7. Which account is the kube-proxy role assigned to?
    - kubectl describe rolebinding kube-proxy -n kube-system 명령어 실행


8. A user dev-user is created. User's details have been added to the kubeconfig file. Inspect the permissions granted to the user. Check if the user can list pods in the default namespace.<br>
Use the --as dev-user option with kubectl to run commands as the dev-user.
    - 



9. Create the necessary roles and role bindings required for the dev-user to create, list and delete pods in the default namespace.<br>
Use the given spec:
    - kubectl create role developer --namespace=default --verb=list,create,delete --resource=pods 명령어로 role 생성
    - kubectl create rolebinding dev-user-binding --namespace=default --role=developer --user=dev-user 명령어로 role 부여


10. A set of new roles and role-bindings are created in the blue namespace for the dev-user. However, the dev-user is unable to get details of the dark-blue-app pod in the blue namespace. Investigate and fix the issue.<br>
We have created the required roles and rolebindings, but something seems to be wrong.
    - kubectl edit role developer -n blue 명령어로 resourceNames  필드 제거


11. Add a new rule in the existing role developer to grant the dev-user permissions to create deployments in the blue namespace.<br>
Remember to add api group "apps".
    - kubectl edit role developer -n blue 로 편집
    ```
