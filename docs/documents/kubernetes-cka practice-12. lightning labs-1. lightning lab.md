1. Upgrade the current version of kubernetes from 1.30.0 to 1.31.0 exactly using the kubeadm utility. Make sure that the upgrade is carried out one node at a time starting with the controlplane node. To minimize downtime, the deployment gold-nginx should be rescheduled on an alternate node before upgrading each node.<br>
Upgrade controlplane node first and drain node node01 before upgrading it. Pods for gold-nginx should run on the controlplane node subsequently.
