1. What secret type must we choose for docker registry?
    - kubectl create secret --help 실행


2. We have an application running on our cluster. Let us explore it first. What image is the application using?
    - kubectl describe deploy web 실행


3. We decided to use a modified version of the application from an internal private registry. Update the image of the deployment to use a new image from myprivateregistry.com:5000<br>
The registry is located at myprivateregistry.com:5000. Don't worry about the credentials for now. We will configure them in the upcoming steps.
    - kubectl edit deploy web
    - myprivateregistry.com:5000/nginx:alpine 로 이미지 변경


4. Are the new PODs created with the new images successfully running?
    - no


5. Create a secret object with the credentials required to access the registry.<br>
Name: private-reg-cred<br>
Username: dock_user<br>
Password: dock_password<br>
Server: myprivateregistry.com:5000<br>
Email: dock_user@myprivateregistry.com<br>
    - kubectl create secret docker-registry private-reg-cred --docker-username=dock_user --docker-password=dock_password --docker-server
=myprivateregistry.com:5000 --docker-email=dock_user@myprivateregistry.com 입력



6. Configure the deployment to use credentials from the new secret to pull images from the private registry
    - kubernetes docs에서 image pull secret
    - kubectl edit deploy web 으로 아래 형태로 적용
    ```
    spec:
    containers:
    - name: private-reg-container
        image: <your-private-image>
    imagePullSecrets:
    - name: private-reg-cred
    ```
