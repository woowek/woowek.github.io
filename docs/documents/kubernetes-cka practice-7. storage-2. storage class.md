1. How many StorageClasses exist in the cluster right now?
    - kubectl get sc


2. How about now? How many Storage Classes exist in the cluster?<br>
We just created a few new Storage Classes. Inspect them.
    - kubectl get sc




3. What is the name of the Storage Class that does not support dynamic volume provisioning?
    - no-provisioner 을 사용하는 경우  dynamic volume 을 지원하지 않는다.




4. What is the Volume Binding Mode used for this storage class (the one identified in the previous question)?
    - 



5. What is the Provisioner used for the storage class called portworx-io-priority-high?
    - k describe sc portworx-io-priority-high 실행


6. Is there a PersistentVolumeClaim that is consuming the PersistentVolume called local-pv?
    - k get pvc



7. Let's fix that. Create a new PersistentVolumeClaim by the name of local-pvc that should bind to the volume local-pv.<br>
Inspect the pv local-pv for the specs.
    - 다음과 같이 작성
    ```
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
    name: local-pvc
    spec:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    storageClassName: local-storage
    resources:
        requests:
        storage: 500Mi
    ```


8. What is the status of the newly created Persistent Volume Claim?
    - k get pvc


9. Why is the PVC in a pending state despite making a valid request to claim the volume called local-pv?<br>
Inspect the PVC events.
    - 


10. The Storage Class called local-storage makes use of VolumeBindingMode set to WaitForFirstConsumer. This will delay the binding and provisioning of a PersistentVolume until a Pod using the PersistentVolumeClaim is created.
    - 


11. Create a new pod called nginx with the image nginx:alpine. The Pod should make use of the PVC local-pvc and mount the volume at the path /var/www/html.<br>
The PV local-pv should be in a bound state.
    - kubectl run nginx --image=nginx:alpine --dry-run=client -oyaml > nginx.yaml 실행
    - 다음 내용 적용
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    name: nginx
    labels:
        name: nginx
    spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx
        image: nginx:alpine
        volumeMounts:
        - name: local-persistent-storage
            mountPath: /var/www/html
    volumes:
        - name: local-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: local-pvc
    ```



12. What is the status of the local-pvc Persistent Volume Claim now?
    - k get pvc



13. Create a new Storage Class called delayed-volume-sc that makes use of the below specs:<br>
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner<br>
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
    - 다음 명령어 실행
    ```
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
    name: delayed-volume-sc
    provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
    volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
    ```
