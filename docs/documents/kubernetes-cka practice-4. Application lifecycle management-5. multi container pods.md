3. Create a multi-container pod with 2 containers.
    Use the spec given below:
    If the pod goes into the crashloopbackoff then add the command sleep 1000 in the lemon container.
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    name: yellow
    spec:
    containers:
    - name: lemon
        image: busybox
        command:
        - sleep
        - "1000"
    - name: gold
        image: redis
    ```


8. Edit the pod in the elastic-stack namespace to add a sidecar container to send logs to Elastic Search. Mount the log volume to the sidecar container.


Only add a new container. Do not modify anything else. Use the spec provided below.
```

```
