6. The reason the application is failed is because we have not created the secrets yet. Create a new secret named db-secret with the data given below.
    You may follow any one of the methods discussed in lecture to create the secret.    
```
kubectl create secret generic db-secret --from-literal=DB_Host=sql01 --from-literal=DB_User=root --from-literal=DB_Password=password123
```






7. Configure webapp-pod to load environment variables from the newly created secret.
    Delete and recreate the pod if required.
```
spec:
  containers:
  - image: kodekloud/simple-webapp-mysql
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    name: webapp
    envFrom:
    - secretRef:
        name: db-secret
```
